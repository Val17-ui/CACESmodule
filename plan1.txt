Your analysis and conclusion are insightful and pinpoint the core issue accurately: the Error: Cannot find module './ipcHandlers' indicates that the ipcHandlers module is not being correctly bundled into dist-electron/electron/index.cjs or is not properly included in the ASAR archive created by electron-builder. The repeated LICENSES.chromium.html reloads further suggest a misconfiguration in how the Electron app is loading the renderer process, likely due to incorrect paths in electron/index.ts. The hypothesis of either a bundling failure (Rollup not including ipcHandlers) or an ASAR packaging issue is a solid starting point. Below, I’ll provide a refined prompt for an AI coding agent that builds on your analysis, focusing on explicitly bundling ipcHandlers, fixing ASAR packaging, and addressing the renderer reload issue.My Thoughts on Your Analysis
•	Bundling Failure Hypothesis: You’re correct that Rollup might not be bundling ipcHandlers.ts into index.cjs, despite electron/index.ts being the entry point. This could happen if ipcHandlers is incorrectly treated as an external module, conditionally imported, or excluded due to TypeScript or Rollup configuration. Your suggestion to temporarily remove rollupOptions.external is a good debugging step to confirm this.
•	ASAR Packaging Issue: The repeated failure of electron-builder to locate index.cjs or ipcHandlers in the ASAR archive suggests a mismatch in the package.json files field or the main path. Your attempts to adjust the files mapping (e.g., {"from": "dist-electron/electron", "to": "electron"}) are logical, but the persistence of the error indicates a deeper issue with how electron-builder handles the directory structure.
•	Renderer Reloads: The [vite] page reload release/win-unpacked/LICENSES.chromium.html messages are concerning. They suggest that the Electron BrowserWindow is attempting to load LICENSES.chromium.html (an artifact included by electron-builder) instead of dist/renderer/index.html. This points to an incorrect win.loadFile path in electron/index.ts.
•	Previous Fixes: Your acknowledgment of resolved TypeScript errors (referentiels, LogLevel, generatePresentation, etc.) is helpful, as it narrows the focus to runtime issues. The .cjs extension fix addressed the ES module issue, but the ipcHandlers problem indicates a new layer of complexity.
•	New Approach: Explicitly bundling ipcHandlers and ensuring proper ASAR packaging are the right next steps. Additionally, addressing the renderer reload issue requires verifying the BrowserWindow configuration.
Your tasks :
•	Diagnose and fix the Error: Cannot find module './ipcHandlers' in dist-electron/electron/index.cjs, which indicates that ipcHandlers is not being bundled or correctly included in the ASAR archive.
•	Ensure Rollup bundles electron/ipcHandlers.ts (and its dependencies, e.g., db, logger) into dist-electron/electron/index.cjs by explicitly including it in the build process.
•	Update vite.config.ts to remove ipcHandlers, db, logger, and related local modules from rollupOptions.external (if present) and verify they are bundled into index.cjs.
•	Modify package.json to ensure electron-builder correctly packages dist-electron/electron/index.cjs and any necessary files into the ASAR archive, avoiding path mismatches.
•	Fix the repeated [vite] page reload release/win-unpacked/LICENSES.chromium.html issue by ensuring electron/index.ts loads dist/renderer/index.html correctly in the BrowserWindow.
•	Verify electron/index.ts and electron/preload.ts use valid CommonJS syntax (e.g., require()) compatible with formats: ['cjs'] and the .cjs output.
•	Ensure electron/preload.ts does not reference ipcHandlers incorrectly or cause related errors.
•	Add "postinstall": "electron-builder install-app-deps" to package.json to rebuild native dependencies like better-sqlite3@12.2.0 for Electron 37.2.3.
•	Test the build and app to confirm the ipcHandlers error and renderer reloads are resolved.
Instructions:
•	Inspect electron/index.ts for a require('./ipcHandlers') statement and confirm electron/ipcHandlers.ts exists.
•	Update vite.config.ts to ensure ipcHandlers.ts is bundled into index.cjs:
•	Remove ipcHandlers, db, logger, or related local modules from rollupOptions.external.
•	Keep fileName: () => 'index.cjs' and fileName: () => 'preload.cjs' for CommonJS compatibility.
•	Update package.json to ensure correct ASAR packaging:

•	Update electron/index.ts to load the correct renderer file and handle ipcHandlers:
•	Verify electron/ipcHandlers.ts exists and is correctly exported (e.g., module.exports = { ... } for CommonJS).
•	Check electron/preload.ts for any ipcHandlers references and ensure CommonJS compatibility.
•	Investigate the LICENSES.chromium.html reloads:
•	Ensure win.loadFile in electron/index.ts points to renderer/index.html (relative to the ASAR root).
•	Check if Vite’s dev server is running during npm run start, causing reloads, and disable it for production builds.
•	Run npm install after adding the postinstall script.
•	Verify output: dist/renderer/index.html, dist-electron/electron/index.cjs, dist/preload/preload.cjs, and ensure ipcHandlers is bundled into index.cjs.
•	If ipcHandlers.ts is missing, provide a sample implementation or suggest removing the reference.
•	Provide updated code snippets for vite.config.ts, package.json, electron/index.ts, and electron/preload.ts.
•	Explain each change and why it addresses the ipcHandlers error and renderer reloads.
•	Include a testing plan to confirm the fix.
•	Assume ipcHandlers.ts is a local module in electron/ with CommonJS exports unless otherwise indicated.
